Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2022Color: Cross BlueVerified Purchase
First, it wasn't totally compatible with T-Mobile like they advertised; phone would work, but data did not. Sound quality was so poor, both phone calls and listening to the speaker. Photos were washed out.Nice design and huge battery, but that's it. Luckily, I returned it to Amazon.

Me encantó la comodidad de los audífonos, son livianos y el sonido es destacado. Son mis primeros audífonos inear, ya que pensaba que por el tamaño de mis oídos se me caerían, sin embargo, se mantienen muy bien en mis oídos.Estoy muy satisfecho la relación calidad - precio es muy buena

I have used a variety of earbuds/ air pods for a long time  I never knew anything would be better than something like ...Apple... (my apologies to the techies who I might have just offended, I admit I am not well learned of various option for ear buds, i just accepted the obvious answer: Apple...Well these were supposed to be for my kid, and I was going to trade him for his Apple airpod pros... HAHAHA!  Not a chance.  I tried them out first and DEFINTELY will be belonging to ME.I can just see a few engineers starting this company  being like:""Guys, check out the new apple airpods..""**they all test out***And then they all get so excited and freak out because they""re like:""OMGGGG we can do this SO MUCH better for FRACTION of the cost!!!""So, Realme, I thank you for finally giving me the ear bud experience they way it should be!

this is an amazing pair of earbuds, battery is great, sound quality is great and the noise cancellation just 👌Update: after a few months and taking good care of them, one of the earphones isn't working, the sound only comes out from the small breach in the back of the piece. Really sad since I actually liked this product.

Best value for low budgets
Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2022Color: Air 3 BlueVerified Purchase
They are perfect for the price, i have no complaints whatsoever if i consider the price, I’d  say they are absolutely perfect for the price you’re paying, if you don’t want to spend more than 60$ for earbuds you can buy, don’t hesitate to buy these. That being said, i only have to issues with them, and it’s about the fit and the touch gestures, especially if you’re taking calls, anytime I try to adjust them into my ears i accidentally close the calls, and this happens pretty much every time. So I wouldn’t recommend them if you are taking many calls on a daily basis.

Great phone but not compatible with AT&T
Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2022Verified Purchase
Pro: Enjoyed everything about the phone (display, size, camera, processing power, fast charging and so on).Con: After several tickets and calls to/from AT&T working on why my data would not work. It boiled down to this phone is incompatible with AT&T 5G network because to the GSM is not quite enough. It has to be over 1900MHz and this phone is max at 1900MHz. Unfortunately, when one of the representative found out this information my return window was closed. Now, I'm stuck with this phone and still need to buy another one.

Still got some work to do
Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2022Color: Blue SupersonicSize: 128+8GBVerified Purchase
At first this phone seemed like a good fit. It is well priced, slick looking and worked fine. I am in the USA with AT&T network. I was willing to try it given its low night camera quality, etc...After some use you start noticing some ""features"" that do not work and Realme does nothing to improve. For example, when you plug it in to the car auto Android, the phone goes dead slow and the only way out is to reboot the phone every time. Very annoying. I waited for months for this to be fixed but it never did. The only workaround was to go to developer settings to leave the screen on at all times while plugged in... quite annoying.. but livable.The drop that spilt the glass was when AT&T dropped the 3G network in the USA on Feb 22nd 2022, apparently they do a scan of phones not compatible and I was dropped off the network, unable to make or receive calls. To my surprise as this is supposed to be a 5G (or at least a 4G phone compatible with AT&T). After several days and hours on the phone with AT&T they ran the IMEI number and confirmed this phone is not compatible with the USA AT&T Network.Now I am stuck with a phone I cannot use nor return after several months of use.I wouldn't but this again as it is still too early in development to be reliable.

Great phone but NO updates!
Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2022Color: Blue SupersonicSize: 128+8GB
I bought this great phone locally after years of using Samsung mid-ranges. Samsung failed to deliver the right specs for a reasonable price, their last great mid-range was A51. The 2 met lines are more expensive and crippled by birth. That's how I went looking for a better alternative that offered a good cost/benefit ratio without sacrificing specifications.  I love my Realme 8 5G and have not had any functional problems as others describe EXCEPT for the Hide Apps feature.  The screen is just amazing, who needs Amoled?! The cameras are very good too, it even has a macro lens although it's performance is somewhat mediocre (macro!), I would have preferred a built-in FM Radio instead.  I missed the earphones but it comes with a phone charger (I REFUSE to buy a phone without that and YOU should too! Stand for your rights as customer!).  It also has Dual SIM with DEDICATED external memory card slot, I use all 3 at once. Often wonder why people accept a mediocre Hybrid slot in other phones.  Yes, it has an external SD card slot, NEVER buy a phone without that! Sales & Marketing people will tell you Internal memory is enough, but if the phone gets damaged you lose everything! Then they will tell you you can use the Cloud, what? To expose your private stuff? To pay for extra cloud storage? To be FORCED to pay a data subscription? Stand for your rights people! THIS phone has that, so YOU are in control.  However, my only grief is that unless Realme has an official office in your country, you WON'T get any Android or even Security updates! That's right! Mine is region LATAM (type *#6776# in the phone app) and Realme has offices in about 6 countries in this region, but not in mine. That means my device (already 1+ that since launch) has not received NEITHER security updates NOR Android 12 update and they ALL had been promised by the company. So, if there is a RME office in your country, go ahead and it is a good buy, of not then skip it and go for a brand that DELIVERS the promised updates.

After researching for a while I decided to buy realme's newly released narzo 50, High spec for this price, Helio G96 proessor and 120Hz refresh rate, amazing gaming phone. Battery life is as expected and charging is fast. 6.6"" FHD screen is perfect for me. I also like the Kevlar Speed Texture Design. Fingerprint unlock is accurate and fast. Really worth for the money, highly recommend to people searching for best value and high spec cellphone.

a lot of a phone for the price.
Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2022Color: Prism BlackVerified Purchase
If you don't need 5G - this is a fantastic phone for the price. fast, powerful, lots of storage, strongly built. Camera really good. phone sounds clear and loud. seriously better than most other phones I tried - even more expensive. Battery charges in a wink. Overall - way better than anything i tried for this price range. Then, I ordered another one - realme 9 pro+ and it is even better than this. Definitely switching to this brand. Reading reviews I noted that Realme is an off-shot of Oppo. and Oppo is a brand i treasure for many years, leaders in invention and quality. had several BlueRay disk players, and other stuff - loved these.So, thumbs up to RealMe.
